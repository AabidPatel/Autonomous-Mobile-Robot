# Autonomous-Mobile-Robot
Prototype development of Modular Autonomous Mobile Robot with interchangeable extensions to enhance versatility. The primary focus of the Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) is targeted at point-to-point applications within warehouse settings. Specifically, it helps in transporting materials from one station to another as needed. The utilization of LiDAR sensors ensures precise robot localization and navigation, enhancing the efficiency of the entire system.
